        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I come from Kenmore, WA and I went to Inglemoor High School. I have</p>
        <p>an IB diploma, but that didn't get me a lot in college credits. Outside</p>
        <p>of school I also like to play tennis, bake deserts, as well as play music.</p>
        <p>It's been a while since I've picked up a clarinet though, so don't judge</p>
        <p>me to hard!</p>
